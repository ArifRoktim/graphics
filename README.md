Assignment:

Implement the Phong Reflection model with flat shading. (Note: if you look up information online, do not confuse this with Phong Shading).

* You should be calculating I once per polygon.
* Remember to limit I to be in the range [0, 255]. You may not want to do this all at once at the end.
